# Advent-Of-Code-2021
This is my repository for Advent of Code 2021 in Python 3.10

I originally planned to complete this during the Advent of Code competition but didn't have the time. I am now using it to learn Python 3 since much has changed since Python 2 it seems. I haven't touched any Python in many years, so it should be a fun way to relearn.
